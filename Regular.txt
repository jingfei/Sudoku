<h2>This tournament is related to Project #1 - Sudoku</h2>

<h3>Basic:</h3>
<ol><li>You need a header file and a code file named Sudoku.h and Sudoku.cpp </li>
  	<li>At least three member functions, GiveQuestion(), ReadIn() and Solve(), should be defined </li>
  	<li>We'll have programs to check your code by calling the functions.</li>
  	<li>For more details about project 1, you can go to ncku moodle and download the ppt. </li></ol>

<h3>Different from project 1: </h3>
<ol><li>In function GiveQuestion(), you can make questions with unsolvable or multiple solutions here</li>
	<li>You have a time limit 30 seconds.<br/>
